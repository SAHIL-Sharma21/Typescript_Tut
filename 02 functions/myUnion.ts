// HERE we are going to see about union types.
// Union is a combination of 2 or 3 or more types of data that we can include in a variable, Array and etc...

//union types eg:
let score: number | string = 45; // now score can be number or string
score = "4563"; //we are assigning string to score.
console.log(score);
